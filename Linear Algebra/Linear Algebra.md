# Linear Algebra



- Scalars : {$x$ | $x \in \real$  }.Scalar can be $+$ or $- $

- Vector  $\vec{o}$  is a *basis vector* ,{$\vec{o}$ | $\vec{o} \in \real$  }

- Vector Addition and Multiplication

- Vector is rooted at origin 

- Combination of addition and multiplication on  a pair of scalar vectors can yield any vector in that dimension and is called Span those vectors
  - Set of vectors : ( $\vec{v}$ , $\vec{w}$ ) 
  - Scalar vectors :  $a\vec{v}$ , $b\vec{w}$ 
  - Linear Combination   :   $a\vec{v} + b\vec{w}$    = Span of    $\vec{v}$ and $\vec{w}$ 
  - **Exceptions** - 
    -  when  $\vec{v}$ or  $\vec{w}$ are in same line of vector then the only direction linear combination can move is forward or backward. 
    - When both vectors are at origin .
