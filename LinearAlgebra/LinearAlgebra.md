# Linear Algebra



- Scalars : {$x$ | $x \in \real$  }.Scalar can be $+$ or $- $

- Vector  $\vec{o}$  is a *basis vector* ,{$\vec{o}$ | $\vec{o} \in \real$  }

- Vector Addition and Multiplication

- Vector is rooted at origin 

- Combination of addition and multiplication on  a pair of scalar vectors can yield any vector in that dimension and is called Span those vectors
  - Set of vectors : ( $\vec{v}$ , $\vec{w}$ ) 
  - Scalar vectors :  $a\vec{v}$ , $b\vec{w}$ 
  - Linear Combination   :   $a\vec{v} + b\vec{w}$    = Span of    $\vec{v}$ and $\vec{w}$ 
  - **Exceptions** - 
    -  when  $\vec{v}$ or  $\vec{w}$ are in same line of vector then the only direction linear combination can move is forward or backward. 
    - When both vectors are at origin.

#### Understanding LT in Linear Transformation

##### T in Linear Transformation 

​	**Transformation is a fancy word for a function** that takes an input and spits outs an output.		

Or 

​	Which takes in a vector and spits out another vector. 

Transformation is used with respect to movement. Transforming one vector to another vector



##### L in Linear Transformation

A transformation is linear if  and only if

- All lines remains lines  OR Grid Lines are always parallel  and evenly spaced OR Transformations are not curved.
- Origin does not move/is always fixed.



##### Representing Linear Transformation Numerically



 In 2 Dimensions,linear Transformation can be represented using a linear combination of  $\hat{i}$ and $\hat{j}$ , which are basis of two vectors.

 
$$
x\hat{i} + y\hat{j} = \hat{v}
$$


where $\hat{v}$ is the resultant vector.







Output vs Transformed output. Since basis are just number and transformed basis are also just numbers. No matter what number are given with output we can figure out the transformation taking place.



Or given transformation we can figure out output
